# DMWhatsApp

Let's accept the fact that we all hate that moment when have to add a number in our contacts just to start the conversation with someone.
To save this little time, I have made an android application with the help of which you can directly send the message to anyone without saving
their number in your device. 

How to use this application:
1. Download it from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13FaR9KkZday1RxQXNLfLZAbIBn0Q3w1y?usp=sharing (It's completely safe)
2. Install the application.
3. Open you Dial Pad in your phone and enter the number.(like you do for calling)
4. Then long click on that phone number entered by you.
5. Do you see DM Whatsapp option? If yes click on that either click on menu/view more icon and you will find DM Whatsapp option.
6. From there you will be redirected to whatspp to with chat window opened with that number.

It's as simple as that.
